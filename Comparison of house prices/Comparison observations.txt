While commenting on the sample:
The industry report suggests that the average difference in the selling and asking price is of $6000.

From the above observations we see that the average price difference for both the SRES and Wallace sample is not exactly the same.

While commenting on Population based on sample size of 79 we conclude the following:
They are approximately $6000 , but since this is a sample we can calculate the Confidence interval to see if the report will hold true , for the population.

On finding the confidence interval, say for 95%, the range is between 5678.875  and 9765.569 for SRES and 
3121.239 and 7598.761 for Wallace hence contain the population mean as per the report in this interval

Hence, the industry report does hold true for both Wallace and SRES. 

We can comments on Benty’s concerns as follows:
1)	The Asking Price of ‘Wallace’ is generally lesser than ‘SRES’
2)	The Selling Price of ‘Wallace’ is also generally lesser than ‘SRES’.

The interesting observations that we can derive from the tables created are:

1)	The ‘Condo Apartments’ sold by SRES and ‘Single Family Detached’ houses sold by Wallace are of the same proportion. 
2)	Similarly, the ‘’Condo Apartments sold by Wallace and ‘Townhouses’ sold by SRES are of the same proportion. 
3)	One-tenth of the total ‘Townhouses’ sold is by Wallace .
