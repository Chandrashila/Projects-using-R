 The Eastern Café has three very popular dishes: Yang Chow fried rice, pan fried noodles, and
General Tso’s chicken. The owner of the restaurant would like to better understand the process of order
arrival and delivery during the peak hour from 5 p.m. to 6 p.m. To do so, she has collected a data set
concerning orders placed during that time period in the last 120 days. The data set can be found in the
Excel file named “EasternCafe.xlsx”. 
The data set contains six variables:
1.Order #: An index to refer to the orders.
2.Day: Day on which the order was placed (takes values from 1 to 120).
3.Y: Whether the order included a Yang Chow fried rice dish (Yes or No).
4.N: Whether the order included a pan fried noodles dish (Yes or No).
5.T: Whether the order included a General Tso’s chicken dish (Yes or No).
6.Time: Delivery time of the order in minutes.
To help the owner, we perform statistical analysis using R Studio to answer following questions:

a) Delivery time will exceed 20 minutes.
b) Delivery time will be below 10 minutes.
c) 90% of the delivery times will be under how many minutes?
d) 90% of the delivery times will be above how many minutes? 
e) Can we recommend dish (main course+ side dish) combinations to customers depending on the combination probabilities of orders?
f) Given that 20 orders were placed, can we predict fewer than half of those orders will contain the chicken dish.
g) Can we predict 90% of the days there will be fewer than how many orders?
