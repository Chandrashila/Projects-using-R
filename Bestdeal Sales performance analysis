The manager of Best Deal, a local electronic appliance retailer, would like to assess how good each of their sales personnel is and, in particular, which individuals are high and
low performers. Data have been gathered from a sample of 10 employees in the Sales Department and stored in an Excel file named “Bestdeal.xlsx”. 
The file contains daily sales values (rounded to the nearest integer) from each of the sampled employees for the last six months. The average daily sales for the combined employee 
data is around $146. Some employees seem to be consistently selling above this average, but the manager wants more statistical evidence. The store is closed on Sundays and each of
the employees had 10 paid time off days that they have used at their own discretion during the data collection period. To help the manager, we use R Studio to determine the high 
performer and low performer employees.
