The IRS uses regression models to predict what taxes are typically owed based on a small set of variables from tax returns. The predicted values are compared to the actual tax 
paid by an individual to determine how truthful the individual’s return is and decide whether to audit the individual. This way the IRS can develop simple rules 
to automatically determine if a given tax return should be fully audited. To develop one of such models, we use dataset entitled “Taxes.xlsx”. Using R Studio we built 
a regression model to determine suspicious tax returns.
